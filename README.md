# Imports Module Definition

IMD is an implementation of the
[AMD specification](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md) that
performs absolutely no loading. The primary goal of it is to play nice with
HTML Imports, but it should work well with any code loader that doesn't mandate
a particular module registry.

## Why IMD?

JavaScript module systems generally perform three different tasks:

  1. **Definition** Allow module authors to define an encapsulated unit of code,
     including what other modules it depends on.
  2. **Resolving** Given a module reference, resolve it to an actual module
     instance. This typically involves a central module registry that maps
     module names to instances.
  3. **Loading** Given a module reference that is not yet loaded into the
     registry, load it from some source, usually a URL (via an XHR).

IMD only performs the first two tasks, in a way that's fully compliant with the
AMD spec.

This is the minimal module system needed if you're already loaded your script
resources via HTML Imports. HTML Imports handily takes care of loading resources
and their transitive dependencies, de-duplicating imports, and executing scripts
in the correct order.

Together, IMD and HTML Imports form a really great module system. Some of the
benefits over RequireJS include:
  * IMD is extremely small. With no loading code, IMD is almost entirely just a
    AMD-compiant registry in just 150 lines of code (with comments).
  * A module defined in an HTML Import can be sure its non-script resources,
    like CSS and HTML templates, have been loaded as well.
  * Browsers with native HTML Import support can aggressively pre-scan and
    pre-load HTML Imports by reading the `<link>` tags.
  * Servers that support HTTP/2 Push can easily read `<link>` tags and
    preemptively push dependencies, resulting in very fast load times.

## What about ES6 (ES2015) Modules?

They're great. Really, we can't wait for them to be implemented natively in
browsers. And until then, compilers and loaders like SystemJS and Babel do
allow developers to use ES6 modules now, _if_ they're willing to deal with a
build step.

Not every project can or wishes to do so, and HTML Imports is not a JavaScript
module definition system, so IMD is an extremely lightweight way to use modules
on top of imports.

When the ES6 module loader spec is further along, we will look into ways of
integrating the two so that JavaScript can import HTML "modules" and vice-versa.
We're very excited about the possibilities for interop.

## How Do I?

### Download and Include IMD

IMD is distributed as an HTML Import-able HTML file, naturally. Install and uselike this:

Install:
```
> bower install PolymerLabs/IMD --save
```

Import:

```html
<link rel="import" href="../imd/imd.html">
```

We recommend that HTML files that require or define _do_ _not_ directly import
IMD, but rather let the main page import IMD, usually as the very first import.
This is so that an application that really requires RequireJS to load modules
(this can be true when loading pure JS modules with no corresponding `<script>`
tags), can setup RequireJS instead of IMD. Since IMD is fully AMD compliant,
all modules defined in HTML imports will work just fine.

### Define a Module

Modules are defined exactly as in other AMD systems like RequireJS:
Public modules are defined by name:

Here's the definition of a mythical module, 'squidbits', that depnds on the
modules 'tentacles.html', and 'ink':

```javascript
define('squidbits', ['./tentacles.html', 'ink'], function(tentacles, ink) {
  return {tentacles: tentacles, ink: ink, squidbits: true};
});
```

Now, since IMD is targeted at projects already using HTML Imports, it's likely
that the module will be defined inside an HTML file, like so:

```html
<link rel="import" href="./tentacles.html">
<script src="ink.js"></script>

<script>
define('squidbits', ['./tentacles.html', 'ink'], function(tentacles, ink) {
  return {tentacles: tentacles, ink: ink, squidbits: true};
});
</script>
```

Notice the `<link>` and `<script>` tags. These tell the browser to load
'tentacles.html' and 'ink.js'. Because scripts are blocked until imports and
other scripts have loaded and run, and 'tentacles.html' and 'ink.js' define
modules, `squidbits`'s dependencies are guaranteed to be loaded and registered
when the inline script runs.

_Note that we're assuming that `ink.js` defines a `ink` module here, and
`tentacles.html` defines an anonymous module._

## Define Anonymous / Relative Modules

Private (relative) module names are inferred from the current import:

`tentacles.html`:
```html
<script>
define(function() {
  return /* module contents */;
})
</script>
```

This module is available at a relative URL, as shown in the above `squidbits`
example. There can be only one anonymous module per HTML document.

If you want to use an existing anonymous module (say, something defined
following the [UMD pattern](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)), give it a name with
the `as` attribute on a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="thingo.js" as="thingy"></script>
```

## Future work

### HTML dependencies.

Imagine:

 `foo.html`:
 ```html
 <template id="bar">...</template>
 ```

You could import a document:
 `index.html`:
 ```javascript
 define(['foo.html'], function(foo) {
   // foo is a document
   let bar = foo.querySelector('#bar');
   document.appendChild(document.importNode(bar.content));
 })
 ```

Or a node directly:
 `index.html`:
 ```javascript
 define(['foo.html#bar'], function(bar) {
   // bar is a HTMLTemplate node!
   document.appendChild(document.importNode(bar.content));
 })
 ```

### Reduced import/define duplication

The one downside of IMD relative to RequireJS is that dependencies often appear
twice in a file: once as a HTML Import and one in the `define()` call. We could
conceivably infer the dependency list from the imports so that there's no
duplication.

### ES6

There is a lot to explore with ES6 module loading and HTML Imports. The loading
and ordering semantics appear to be fully compatible, and given a configurable
enough loader we should be able to let ES6 modules import HTML nodes and
vice-versa.
